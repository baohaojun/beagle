Beagle is resurrected. I forked this from [[https://github.com/GNOME/beagle][GNOME/beagle]] and fixed
compilation errors and some runtime errors.

I do this so that I can search my maildir emails. The Emacs GNUS
search is too slow.

I am using beagle on Debian testing, where gmime-sharp 2.6 is
installed which is fairly broken. I can't index any of my email using
it. So I have switched to use MimeKit.

To build this version of beagle, you need:

1. Get MimeKit installed into your =~/.mono/MimeKit.1.0.3.0/=. You can
   use nuget for this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo apt-get install nuget
   mozroots --import --sync
   cd ~/.mono && nuget install MimeKit
   #+END_SRC

2. Do the build the old way:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd beagle/beagle
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make -j8
   sudo make install
   #+END_SRC

To use beagle to scan my mail folders under ~/Maildir, I did these things:

1. Create a .MAIL-FOLDER.index for each MAIL-FOLDER that I want to index:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   cd ~/Maildir
   for x in */; do touch .${x%/}.index; done
   #+END_SRC

2. Start beagled, you must export MONO_PATH to include MimeKit:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   export MONO_PATH=~/.mono/MimeKit.1.0.3.0/lib/net40/
   beagled --debug --fg --indexing-delay 2
   #+END_SRC

3. Do the search with beagle-search:
