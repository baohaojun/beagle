This xdgmime implementation is copied out of GTK+ rather than being the
upstream repository.  The upstream version appears to be unmaintained,
and the GTK+ version contains a number of bug fixes that are currently
in the freedesktop.org bugzilla but ignored.

If you find bugs or want to make changes here, please first check to
see if it's been fixed in the GTK+ version instead:

    http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/gtk%2B/trunk/gtk/xdgmime/ChangeLog?view=markup

If it's out of date, please feel free to update it.  Moreover, the list
of upstream xdgmime bugs is here:

    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&bug_status=__all__&product=xdgmime&content=&order=bugs.delta_ts&query_based_on=

At the time of this writing, we've hit the following three bugs in Beagle,
all of which are fixed in the GTK+ copy and none of which are fixed in the
upstream copy: #5241, #6824, #7496, #9544, #9560.
