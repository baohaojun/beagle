These are the Snowball programs that stem various languages. These are included
verbatim from the original Snowball code. The langcode_mapping file maps which
programs Beagle actually uses to stem the particular language. Note that this
file is only used at build time, at runtime Reflection is used to figure out
which code to use.

It's as simple as it can get, '<langcode> <path-to-program>'. It's important
that a language code is only included ONCE, or else death-by-Automake will
occur; the easiest way is to just keep the file in alphabetical order.
