This is an Epiphany extension that allows Beagle to index every page
the user views.  The code is derived from Dashboard's extension.

Right now, this extension is just a hack: for every page, Epiphany tries to
run a program named 'beagle-epiphany-index'.  The page's URI and title are
passed to beagle-epiphany-index as command-line arguments, and the HTML is
written to its stdin.

Obviously this opens up a huge security hole: anyone who can get a rogue
program named 'beagle-epiphany-index' into the user's path can spy on all of
their web traffic.  

There is also the issue of private information (account numbers, etc.) ending
up in the index.  To try to avoid this, beagle-epiphany-index will not index
https:// URIs.
