This is a small adaptor that translates between the Xesam search API
(http://freedesktop.org/wiki/XesamSearchLive) and Beagle's native search
interface. It is currently incomplete.

To test this, you need the DBus service running:

1) ./autogen.sh

2) make

3) cd src/

4) ./run xesam-adaptor.exe

5) Use your xesam client to connect (see
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/XesamSearchLive for an example client)
