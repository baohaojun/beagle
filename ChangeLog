2007-11-09 20:53  arunsr

	* : * Make the adaptor "make install"able
	  * Move to NDesk DBusSharp 0.6.0 (we're still using our own copy
	  for now, though)

2007-11-01 14:23  arunsr

	* : * Implement GetHitData() method
	  * Convert "int"s in interface to "uint"s

2007-11-01 09:34  arunsr

	* : Update to conform to the Xesam 0.9 RC1 spec. Pending failures
	  from Mikkel's suite:
	  
	  * testGetHitsOnHitsAddedCQ causes beagle to throw an exception --
	  need to debug
	  
	  * GetHitDataTests fail because GetHitData isn't yet implemented

2007-10-01 13:19  arunsr

	* : Handle null Hit.MimeType (thanks to Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen
	  for pointing this out)

2007-09-20 05:24  arunsr

	* : One more fix to conform to the spec -- always emit HitsAdded
	  (independent of search.live)

	* : SearchDone should be emitted even if search.live is false

2007-09-19 08:19  arunsr

	* : * UserQueries are just passed through to beagled now (this will
	  make it work for simple cases, where the beagle search UI and
	  XesamUserQueryLanguage overlap)
	  * Add some error checking

2007-09-19 07:52  arunsr

	* : More changes to adhere to the spec, and some work towards
	  mapping Xesam ontology to Beagle's (grimace)

2007-09-19 06:51  arunsr

	* : Make us conform to the lastest spec (and fix a bug in
	  GetHitCount (nee CountHits))

2007-07-13 05:27  arunsr

	* : Fix non-live searches to work as intended in the spec.

2007-07-04 09:24  arunsr

2007-06-16 15:55  arunsr

	  Will now work with xesam-tools-0.3.0 and above only.

2007-06-12 17:59  arunsr

	* : Skeleton implementation of the Xesam API (minus GetState and
	  GetHitData).
