A few quick notes about I18N support in Beagle
--------------

Developers:

I18N support is provided with the use of good old gettext/intltool and is very
straight forward. In code (C#) you can fetch translated strings with
Mono.Unix.Catalog.GetString ("Text to be translated") and in the templates'
HTML files with the new text macro, eg. simply writing @text%Text to be translated@.

Translators:

You can extract translatable strings from the source files listed in
po/POTFILES.in with standard xgettext with the C# language mode. Translatable
strings are also found in the Tiles/template-*.html files with prefix "@text%"
and suffix "@".
