Version 0.2.15
25 January 2007

Notable changes:

* Beagle now users the .NET 2.0 profile and is compiled with gmcs,
  giving us access to generics.

* Support added for Linux's relatively new SCHED_BATCH scheduler
  policy.

* Infrastructure added to limit helper programs in terms of CPU time
  and address space using setrlimit(2).

* Disabled building the Thunderbird backend by default; it's too
  memory hungry and buggy at this point.

* Added KOrganizer and Konversation backends.

* Many memory usage improvements, especially with IMAP accounts in the
  Evolution mail backend and when doing queries.

* A rewritten and massively improved RTF filter.

* The MS Word filter has been moved into an external process,
  improving service reliability tremendously.

* Dozens of improvements to the filter code, including single
  instantiation of filter objects, reading smaller chunks of data from
  files, and other bug fixes.

* Fixed a problem where file attributes stored in the sqlite DB
  weren't removed if we later stored them in extended attributes.

* Removed the rarely-used Google backend, since Google stopped
  providing API keys.

* Install a greatly improved beagle-dump-index tool, for examining the
  data inside indexes.

* Many rendering improvements and bug fixes to the GUI.

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.14
14 December 2006

Daemon/Infrastructure:
* Added the infrastructure necessary to handle indexing of archive
  files.  (Debajyoti Bera, Daniel Drake)
* Fix many issues with dates because .NET 1.1 was interpreting the
  dates as local time, not UTC.  (Bera)
* Indexables are no longer marked as indexed until all of its children
  are indexed first.  (Bera)
* Add infrastructure to signal clients when we're doing the initial
  index.  (Joe Shaw)
* Changes to how child indexables are dealt with in the index.  (Bera)
* Work around a bug in Mono 1.2.1, so that Beagle doesn't incorrectly
  think your home directory is on a remote filesystem like NFS.  (Joe)
* Use the XDG autostart specification to autostart the daemon, and
  deprecate the old --autostarted flag.  (Joe)
* Fix a URI comparison problem that would cause files to be repeatedly
  reindexed.  (Bera)
* Fix a bug in the tokenizer so that "001234" is tokenized as "1234".
  (Bera)
* Tokenize longer numbers, like international phone numbers.  (Bera)
* After we store child indexable streams in the helper, close them
  rather than letting the GC do it for us.  (Joe)
* Don't set the "source" on indexables if they are already set.  This
  allows indexing service clients to set their own "source" names.
  (Bera)
* Added a handler for SIGUSR2 to the helper process, which will print
  out what file it is currently filtering.  Should help debugging 100%
  CPU issues greatly.  (Joe)
* Greatly improve logging in the daemon and helper.  (Joe)

Backends:
* Support child indexables in the file system backend.  (Bera)
* Report progress percentages in the Evolution mail backend.  (Joe)

Filters:
* Added a new archive filter, to handle zip, tar, gzip and bzip2
  archives.  (Joe, Veerapuram Varadhan, Bera)
* Limit the archive filter to only index 30 files inside archives for
  now, to avoid excessive disk usage.  (Joe)
* Added Scribus filter.  (Alexander Macdonald)
* Fix a crash and clean up the code in the SVG filter.  (Alexander)
* Fix a potential crash in the HTML filter.  (Bera)
* Use the current encoding when decoding URLs in the HTML filter.
  (Bera)
* Add text/troff to the list of supported MIME types in the man page
  filter.  (Joe)
* Turn on snippeting in the man page filter.  (Joe)

Bindings:
* Fix a logic bug in libbeagle that would cause responses to get lost
  if different complex messages were sent to the daemon.  (Joe)
* Print out the response in libbeagle apps if ENABLE_XML_DUMP is
  defined.  (Joe)
* Set the correct time zone info in BeagleTimestamp.  (Bera)
* Add example code for using the indexing service APIs.  (Bera)

Tools:
* Only show the timestamp in beagle-extract-content if it's valid.
  (Joe)
* Fix a problem in which child indexables from archives weren't being
  cleaned up in beagle-extract-content.  (Bera)
* Only show the number of total hits if we're in verbose mode with
  beagle-query, so that scripts can still easily deal only with URIs.
  (Joe)
* Add support to beagle-settings to handle autostarting the daemon and
  UI with the XDG autostart spec.  (Joe)
* Show the percentages of progress in beagle-index-info for the
  backends that support it.  (Joe)
* Remove dead webservices code from beagle-settings tool.  (Joe)
* Fix a problem in which passing in --disable-directories to
  beagle-crawl-system would override --disable-filtering.  (Joe, 
  Pat Double)

UI:
* Show an informational box when the daemon is in the process of
  indexing the user's data.  (Lukas Lipka, Joe)
* New tile to show files inside archives.  (Joe)
* Added a status bar, and display in it the total number of matching
  documents and the number that are currently displayed.  (Joe)
* Fix some rendering ugliness in the details pane if you resized it.
  (Joe)
* Add support for xdg-open if present.  (Joe)
* Fix the build so that Thunderbird was correctly opened from tiles.
  (Kevin Kubasik)
* Fix a crash in the image tile if the file didn't have an extension.
  (Kevin)
* Fix web tiles opening the handler for the MIME type, rather than the
  handler for the URL.  (Kevin, Joe)
* Fix a crash on right-click when the "Open With..." menu would have
  been blank.  (Joe)
* Use the XDG autostart spec to autostart beagle-search, and deprecate
  the old --autostarted method.  (Joe)
* Fix a potential crash in the image tile in the unlikely event that
  we'd attempt to composite the F-Spot logo on top of a standard MIME
  icon.  (Joe)
* Don't scale up RSS feed icons.  Liferea stores icons mostly at 16x16
  or 32x32, and those look terrible.  (Joe)

Memory optimizations:
* Fix a big leak in which we were leaking Lucene IndexReader
  instances.  This substantially reduces memory usage.  (Joe)
* Plug a leak in which QueryWorker instances were never removed from a
  static hash table.  (Joe)
* Don't store full Hit objects in the QueryWorker's URI hash table,
  since they're never used and hold references on a lot of objects.
  (Joe)
* Fix a leak of URIs in LuceneFileQueryable, which is the base class
  for most of the smaller backends.  (Joe)
* Fix a leak in which the list of all the Evolution accounts were
  stored for each folder.  (Joe)
* Avoid some unnecessary boxing in Lucene, reducing memory usage.
  (Joe)
* For all our non-tokenized fields, turn off storing norms in the
  Lucene index.  This will save disk and memory usage for those
  fields.  (Joe)
* Make the code in the IndexerRequest class a little better about
  object allocations.  (Joe)
* Fix an issue where characters were boxed every time we processed a
  URI.  This heavily reduces memory allocations.  (Joe)
* Use UTC when calculating load averages, to avoid uncessary
  allocations related to timezones.  (Joe)
* If --heap-buddy or --heap-shot are passed to the daemon, assume
  --debug-memory.  (Joe)
* If running with --heap-shot and the RSS increases by more than 5% or
  5 megs, or the Mono heap size increases by more than 10%,
  automatically send SIGPROF to the daemon to generate a memory
  snapshot.  (Joe)

  filtering.  (Joe, Bera)
* Only build the po directory if we're building the GUI.  (Joe)
* Update the build system to use gnome-common's gnome-autogen.sh if
  it's available.  If not, use our own included copy.  (Joe)

  at startup by changing how certain pluggable components are
  detected.  Filter and backend authors, see IMPORTANT NOTE below.
  (Joe Shaw, Debajyoti Bera, Kevin Kubasik)

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.0
September 15, 2005

Daemon/Infrastructure:
* New and vastly improved Lucene infrastructure. Highlights include:
  + The indexing and querying code has been split.  The entire
    architecture is much cleaner, and we have been able to eliminate
    several horrible hacks that had been introduced for the benefit
    of the file system backend.
  + The index is now semi-transactional; we can make now make some
    guarantees about the index and the beagle-specific filesystem
    metadata not getting dangerously out-of-sync in the event of a
    crash.
  + It is now possible to efficiently modify certain index properties.
  + Hits now are returned in time-order, not score-order.  Scores
    are still available, though will not agree with the old scores
    in some cases.
  + Querying is faster, our query language is better, and the query
    semantics are much more sane.
  + We are much more intelligent about when we optimize the Lucene indexes.
  + Indexables are now abstract indexing requests, and IndexableGenerators
    can thus now manipulate the index in arbitrary ways.
  + Many, many bugs have been fixed.
  (Jon Trowbridge, Joe Shaw, Fredrik Hedberg, Daniel Drake)
* Many bugs involving queries have been fixed, and the query semantics have
  changed.  Querys now default to 'AND', not 'OR'. (Jon, Joe)
* Fixes to avoid stop words ("a", "the", etc.) causing problems during
  queries. (Joe)
* When using a remote home directory, create the unix domain socket
  locally since some filesystems don't support them (like smbfs). (Joe)

  return the N most recent hits, not the N highest-scoring hits. (Jon)
* Don't reload config files that haven't changed since we last loaded them.
  (Daniel)
* Reduce inotify watch masks when we can. (Daniel)
* Maintain parent-child relationships when watches are moved. (Daniel)
* Fix a crasher in libbeagle related to using g_stat(). (Joe)
* Update to gtk-sharp 2.x APIs. (Joe, Lluís Pàmies)
* Add an --enable-xml-dump configure option for debugging message
  passing between components. (Joe)

  along with the query results, for use by the client app when
  highlighting matches, etc. (Jon)

Backends:

* Rewrite Evolution Data Server backend to support all local
  addressbooks and calendars with change notification, based on Varadhan's
  work in evolution-sharp. (Joe)
* Fix a major bottleneck in starting up the mail backend with IMAP
  accounts that would use large amounts of CPU at startup. (Joe)
* Fix a bug where IMAP accounts against Exchange servers weren't being
  indexed. (Joe)
* Index all IM accounts, not just the first one of each type, in the
  Evolution Data Server backend. (Joe)

  but evolution-sharp isn't. (Joe)
* Fix a date bug where some results would display as happening "-N days
  ago". (Joe)
* Thumbnail file hits. (Debajyoti, Joe)
* Don't run the crawler as part of cron.daily, because it can happen at
  any point during the day and it's an expensive operation.  Add a crontab
  entry which runs at 4:30 am. (Joe)
* Update the Best keybinding code from Tomboy.  Fixes many bugs related
  to different modifiers (num lock, scroll lock, alt, etc.) and fixes many
  "BadValue" crashers. (Alex Graveley, Joe)
