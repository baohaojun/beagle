This is a local copy of System.Windows.Forms.RTF from
http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms/System.Windows.Forms.RTF/

System.Windows.Forms.RTF is used internally for the RichText and related controls in System.Windows.Forms. It is not exposed as a public API in mono. Hence we maintain an exact local copy here.

This RTF parser was originally based on a C-based RTF parser written 
by Paul DuBois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu). It came with the following license:

 * This software may be redistributed without restriction and used for
 * any purpose whatsoever.

and was part of the code found in the 'rewind' project.

Initial import from mono revision 69062.
